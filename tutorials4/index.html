    <p><strong>What I learned:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Before and After pseudo elements are <u>OUTSIDE</u> the content of an element. This means its also outside padding, border, and even margin.</li>
        <li>If you wish to put a solid shape as a background for content then decided to add text after, Before and After pseudo elements will come in handy to when adding text</li>
        <li>Before means before the content and After means after; its kinda obvious, but I found out that in its default setting, the before pseudo is normally placed above the content and after pseudo below the content. This can be fixed with <em>"display:;"</em> property.</li>
        <li><b>BONUS</b>: CSS Grid works best with as many grids as possible; I learned the hard way that styling with one to two rows/columns using Grid is very time consuming. It would've been better to use <em>"display: inline block;"</em> with <em>float</em> properties or <em>"display: flex;"</em>.</li>
        <li>(Pa reto naman uwu ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘ˆ)</li>
