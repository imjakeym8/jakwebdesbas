    <p><strong>What I learned:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>CSS Grid can help wrap and position items quickly and easily. What I really like the most is that I can position texts on top of elements without affecting other elements behind it.</li>
        <li>CSS Grid has template areas I can use; its use case is so much similar to HTML semantics and way easier to apply it. You can even assign emojis to it from what I learned (but I didn't apply it here).</li>
        <li>This is very ideal to position contents. Imagine you have an article with its message, profile picture, and username; you can use grid to properly place these items anywhere you desire!</li>
        <li>I have to be careful when sizing <em>"grid-template-rows"</em> and <em>"grid-template-columns</em>; as much as they can wrap when the window is resized, they can still overlap.</li>
    </ul>
